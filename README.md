# Save The Fish

In this game you control an F-150 and have to move it around a fish to block incoming sharks.

As far as narrative goes there isn't much. We just think it is funny to have a car flying around the screen blocking incoming sharks.

You must use your mouse to move to car, when the car comes in contact with a shark it is blocked and removed from the scene.

We went for an underwater aesthetics.

One of the joys for me was picking out the sprites, I probably spent more time on that than anything else. -Hayden

My favorite part was getting the score sheet to finally work had some issue with it but nothing is better than something finally just working - niko

joys and struggles while writing this game

My main struggle was with the score sheet and having all the data stay between scenes. This was because the gamemanager was doing alot of referencing that was scene specific so I had to learn how to reference a different way.

a paragraph discussing the contributions of each team member to the final game.

For this project I mainly worked on the Shark Enemy mechanics. I created the enemy and the script that controls it as well as the scripts for the car to block the sharks. I implamented the randomness of the shark spawn and the increase in difficulty as the fish survives for longer. I also picked out and implamented the sprites used for the game. -Hayden

For this project I mainly did the logic for the shield movement and scoring. I made the score page and connected all the scripts. I was also responsible for the sounds and particles. -Nikolai
